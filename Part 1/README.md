## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher
- Any Java IDE (Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, or NetBeans)
- Basic understanding of Java programming concepts

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mimi-netizen/Core-Java.git
```

2. Open the project in your preferred IDE
3. Navigate to specific modules/packages to run examples

## Usage

Each package contains specific examples and implementations. To use them:

1. Navigate to the desired package
2. Review the source code and comments
3. Run the main classes to see the implementations in action
4. Modify the code to experiment with different scenarios

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! To contribute:

1. Fork the repository
2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/AmazingFeature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add some AmazingFeature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/AmazingFeature`)
5. Open a Pull Request

## Best Practices

- Each package contains well-documented code
- Examples follow Java naming conventions
- Implementation includes proper exception handling
- Code includes necessary comments for better understanding

## Learning Path

1. Start with java_basics
2. Move to oops_concepts
3. Explore inheritance and interfaces
4. Study data structures (arrays, lists, sets, maps)
5. Learn file operations
6. Practice exception handling
7. Explore additional features
